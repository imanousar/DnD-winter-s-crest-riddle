QUESTION = "Enter the 16-letter word which solves the riddle here (capitals, spaces doesn't matter just correct vocabulary):"

DEATH_CAPTION = 'Rolling a 1 here is not an option - Retry'

RIDLLE_2 = """
Now that you've solved riddle 1, you are on your way to the Freljords Peak Inn hotel. However, the road is not very safe, and you should be cautious.

Your task is to find a safe path for you (Wizard & Horse) to reach the Inn located inside the forest. This involves drawing a line to chart your course.

Be careful, though. Monsters are also traveling in the area, each following its specific path. Wolves, bats, trolls, and other creatures have their own routes and do not interfere with each other's paths.

Your goal is to draw lines connecting you to the inn and each monster to its kind without any lines overlapping.

If your path overlaps with a monster's path on your way to the inn, you will lose some points. Remember, monsters are familiar with their paths and never overlap. If you make a mistake in plotting their paths, it will be considered a poor strategy, and you will lose points.
